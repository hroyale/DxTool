<div class="teal">How we calculated your grades</div>
<div class="subTeal">Understanding the Basis of Your Programming Grade</div>
The letter grade and qualitative feedback regarding where
your institution stands with respect to alcohol prevention programs is based upon our
examination and consideration of several key factors, including: 
<ul>
<li>the extent of your prevention
programming </li>

<li>the strength of your programming
based on research evidence, and </li>

<li>how the programs that you identified are being used to target different 
segments of your student population. </li>
</ul>




<p>To develop the underlying scoring rubric, our researchers examined
more than 200 studies on the relative efficacy of a variety of campus alcohol
prevention programs, applying a standardized procedure to assign numeric values
to the reported outcomes of these studies, and then averaging the values across
the set of studies for each of the programs examined. We also noted the
characteristics of the study sample—whether these were a random sample of
students, high-risk students, students mandated to receive the program, or
other subsets of the student population. For several programs that lacked any
evidence of effectiveness in the research literature, we took into
consideration whether there was a sound theoretical basis underlying these
approaches.  </p>


<a name="def" />
<p>In developing the score, we consider how campuses
target their alcohol prevention efforts, whether they be 
<ul>
<li> <i>universal </i>in nature (targeting the entire student body)</li>

<li> <i>selective </i>(targeting known high-risk student groups), or </li>

<li> <i>indicated</i> (targeting students at the early stages of developing
alcohol problems)[1].</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>Applying a public health model grounded in the <i>prevention
paradox[2]</i>,
we place greater emphasis on the scores of universal programs versus selective
or indicated. </p>



<p>In examining the mix of programming a campus may have in place, we do not assume 
that &quot;more is more.&quot; As such, we may determine that a campus has <i>too many</i> programming 
elements, in effect diminishing the impact of more effective programs by depleting the 
resources and attention of prevention personnel. </p>


<p>In our analysis, we assume optimal fidelity among programs administered by respondents, yet we acknowledge that there can be varying degrees of reliability in the actual implementation of campus alcohol prevention programs. Certain prevention programs whose effectiveness rely heavily on principles of best practice but can also be more susceptible to implementation shortfall include efforts such as BASICS, alcohol-free programming, social norms marketing, and many others. We encourage campuses to consult the many free resources that are available to assist them in strengthening the  implementation of these types of programs. For example, many campuses have found our publication  <a
href="http://hs.outsidetheclassroom.com/download-pdf-alcohol-free-options/" target="_new"><i>Using
Alcohol-Free Options to Promote a Healthy Campus Environment</i></a> very helpful in creating effective, high-impact alcohol-free programs and events.  </p>



<div class="subTeal">Understanding the
Basis of Your Institutionalization Grade</div>

<p>The feedback we offer on your responses to this part of The Campus Diagnostic  are based on the best practices of institutions
that have made breakthrough progress in alcohol prevention, and upon hundreds
of interviews with experts,  alcohol prevention professionals and other
officials on campuses across the country. </p>

In a 1994 report, the Institute of Medicine proposed a framework for
classifying prevention based on Gordon's (1987) operational classification of
disease prevention. The IOM model divides the continuum of services into three
parts: prevention, treatment, and maintenance. The prevention category is
divided into three classifications--<i>universal</i>, <i>selective</i>, and <i>indicated</i>
prevention. For more information, visit <a

The prevention paradox describes a somewhat counterintuitive public health phenomenon,
where the greatest negative impact from a disease or disorder occurs among those
considered at low or moderate risk of the disease or disorder, and a relatively
small degree of negative impact comes from the highest risk population. For
more information on how this phenomenon relates to college alcohol prevention
efforts, read Weitzman and Nelson’s paper at <a
href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cas/Documents/paradox/Prev_Paradox.pdf" target="_new">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cas/Documents/paradox/Prev_Paradox.pdf</a>.
